### Overall Layout

Should use a 3 pane layout (Detailed below):

1. Sidebar - Navigation
1. Top Pane - Page-Specific Actions
1. Main Pane

#### Sidebar

This pane will contain top level navigation elements and actions

#### Top Pane

This pane will contain all page-specific elements, such as the WYSIWYG tools, or in-section navigation buttons.

#### Main Pane

This pane will contain the main elements of each page, Reading, Editing, Administrative Tools, Etc.
